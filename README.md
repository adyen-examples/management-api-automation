## Management API Automation

This repository contains a set of snippets using Adyen's [Management API](https://docs.adyen.com/api-explorer/#/ManagementService/v1/overview) that we Developer Advocates use to automate parts of our workflows.

* You can read an introduction about the Management API [on our blog](https://www.adyen.com/blog/automate-workflows-with-management-api).
* The complete description of our Management API is available on the [API Explorer](https://docs.adyen.com/api-explorer/#/ManagementService/v1/overview).

## Prerequisites and Intro

* To use these snippets, you need to have a [test account](https://authn-test.adyen.com/authn/ui/login).
* Those snippets are written in [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/).

### API Keys

To use these snippets, You need to [generate an API KEY](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/api-credentials) and make it available as environment variable under the name MANAGEMENT_KEY.

The snippets will not all need the same roles. You can see a complete list of available roles [here](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/api-credentials/roles).
Typically, you will need roles of the "Management API" type.


## Available snippets

* [CreateCompanyUser](./src/main/kotlin/me/adyen/CreateCompanyUser.kt) - Creates a User on the test environment with a set of rights. We use that snippet to create accounts for our candidates so they can do the technical interview.
  * Required role to run the snippet - "Management APIâ€”Users read and write"
